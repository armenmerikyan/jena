If you care about them, don’t give ‘em a pass! 

Stay hard!

Set the goal for the month to get 15,000 pull-ups and now just wrapping it up! It’s important to set goals-  hourly, daily, monthly, yearly, etc.! Especially if you have been doing it for a long time - find ways to keep the fire burning!

Stay hard!

Time is the one thing that we can not get back.  It’s also the thing that we waste the most of- we give it to the wrong people, we dedicate it to the wrong problems, and we damn sure don’t give enough to ourselves! 

Stop.Wasting.Time.

Stay hard!

Some of you are hesitant to flip the switch. Let me tell you- the second you do, the world will open up for you!

Stay hard!

There is average everywhere. When the dopamine wears off and the setbacks start to rack up, how are you going to escape the dungeon? Stay hard!

What could be better than changing the outcome of a life destined for failure? And people ask if I am happy….

Stay hard!

I am the biggest believer and supporter of doing you! Do you as big and bold as you can! 

Stay hard!

Stay locked in! One second of dropped focus can cost you your dream! Stay hard!

Stop procrastinating! Stop overthinking the process! The change in your life starts when you have the courage to put the action in! 

There are no time-outs in the game of life, the clock is always running! 

Stay hard!

There is a lot of power in “Fuck you.” 

Stay hard!

Good one, 
@WhitneyCummings
 ! Great special! 

Stay hard!

Either you are getting better or you are getting worse, you are not staying the same! 

If you got to the top of the mountain you were climbing, make sure you immediately start looking for yet another mountain to climb!  

Stay hard!

Have a sense of humor while watching this video! No one is talking shit or trying to put anyone down. So don’t look to get your feelings hurt! 

Stay hard!

I know that some of you may not understand this concept but dream big and then figure it the fuck out! 

Dreams are not dreams if you know you can reach and achieve them! 

Stay hard!

Stay hard!

The hard truth is that most of us know exactly what we have to do, we are just searching for an easier way to do it! 

Stay hard!

What the weak and unprepared people don’t understand is that when a savage is down and wounded, that is when they are the most dangerous. 

Stay hard!

It is how we handle those days when life isn’t what we planned or hoped that is the great separator! 

Stay hard!

While it is great to have an opinion and stand for something, you best be sure your shit is tight before you verbalize it. The return blows that you will receive might just be a lot more damaging than the ones you threw! 

Stay hard!

The only excuse you have for not getting it in is because you and you alone chose to not get it in.
You chose something over working out and then you chose to make an excuse as to why you didn’t work out. What you need to do is choose to change your mentality!

Stay hard!

I am truly humbled & honored to share that Can’t Hurt Me has now sold over 5 million copies & Never Finished has sold over 1 million in under 6 months! 

Thank you to all who have read the book(s) or listened to the audiobook(s) - the success is all thanks to your support.

You must realize that if you are in search of finding that new realm, you must be willing to extend yourself to the limit without any guarantee of success. 

Be willing to be the one who is willing to sharpen your sword alone. 

Stay hard!

Never let a motherfucker defame your character. Several people told me to “take the high road”‘but there are so many motherfuckers on that high road that it’s too busy so I am going back to old school Goggins where there are no roads. There are just hard truths and fuck yous.

The dialogue that you will hear in the worst of times will be unfamiliar to you because chances are you haven’t been in this situation before.

Your mind is a weapon. Don’t allow difficult times strip you of the most powerful weapon you will ever have. 

Stay hard!

Stop being a person who looks for the attention, the praise, and the applause. 

You have to know that you put the work in, not just on your body, but most importantly, on your mind.

Many of you haven't found what you truly want in your life. Once you do, I suggest you figure out how to give your all.  The real problem isn't the fear of a fucked up body. It's your fear of the effort required to truly give your all!

There is a start line to quitting and I know exactly where that starts and I am going to take all these motherfuckers there!  Stay hard!

I challenge u for the New Year to take time out for urself. 
Quiet the noise. Reflect. Find what u truly want in life. 
Stop starting things u know u are going to stop anyway. Make sure all of ur time is spent w/ the proper people & on the path leading to ur ultimate destination.

Many Dreams Die While Suffering! 

It’s important that we learn to put things in perspective during moments of uncertainty & panic. You must learn to manage that one second decision when u want to quit & put things back in the proper compartments in ur mind to stay in the fight.

One thing I am most proud of with Never Finished is that the knowledge you will gain from this book isn’t some cookie cutter knowledge. This is real knowledge      that you can not get from some brainstorming sessions. This knowledge comes only from living in the grip of life.

I want to thank all Veterans for fighting for our freedom. It is truly up to us what we choose to do with that freedom. 

We can choose to let life just happen to us or attack life and go to war with ourselves! 

Stay hard!

You need to get to the point in your life where you no longer look at failure as failure rather see it merely as an attempt! 

Remember this- the valiant motherfucker always wins even when the world around you may see you “failing.”

Stay hard!

Everybody says no one’s second book is as good as their first. Boy, are they wrong!
Stay hard!

Be the one willing to test the limits and not give a fuck in doing so! If your goal is to reach the stars, there is a good chance you won’t get there but just imagine how high you will get in attempting to do so! 

Stay hard!

In 1999, I was barely able to run down the street.  

It’s amazing what we can do in a short period of time if we dedicate ourselves to getting better, finding more, and pushing further. 

Stay hard!

I am not talking about a mental condition here, it’s a mindset condition! 
 
And, if you are offended by this, you might be a bitch! 

Stay hard!

It’s not your fault that you make people feel like shit when you continue to grind regardless. Never allow anyone to deter you from giving your all. 

There is no secret to this. It is just having the will to want more. 

Stay hard!

True effort most times does not look pretty. Most times it takes all that you have and then some. You will come out bruised, blistered, and calloused and if you survived that effort to get to the other side of whatever it is, a new you is born. 

Stay hard!

A big shoutout to my crew who was willing to do whatever was required to get me to the finish line. 

When you are going to war, it’s important to only put those motherfuckers in your foxhole who aren’t afraid to fight. 

Stay hard!

Never close your mind off to the possibilities! Stay hard!

I found in life the best way to beat hell and the fire that comes with it, is to start your own internal fire and become hell. By doing that, you are destroying all of the fuels that hell’s fire is trying to take you out with. Stay hard!

The hard work makes it permanent! Stop looking for the easy route to the finish line. While you might get some fast results, the hard work is what leads to lasting results. Long-term results rarely come without suffering. Tattoo that shit on your brain so you never forget!

Don’t let other people’s insecurities get in the way of your success. Some people just don’t want things badly enough to do the work necessary to get there so when you achieve beyond what they even thought was possible, it sparks the hate! There is enough food for everyone to eat

It’s important to fight the urge to take the easier route. While the easier route might still ultimately get you there, what it doesn’t do is train you for the times where the hard route is the only route.  Stay hard!

Success eludes those who believe it is a straight line to get there.

Find the person that truly understands and accepts who you are!

Stay hard! 

P.S. She didn't faint!

Sometimes the hell in front of you can be so dark and painful that it is incomprehensible but we still must fight. It is in those moments when everyone else wants to quit that you must step up and be that one warrior. We all got some dog in us!!!! Feed that motherfucker!

We must fight with all we have to achieve the very things we want to achieve. Just know that things are not going to get easier, you need to get harder! 

Stay hard!

Don’t allow your setback to be your great demise. Put some hate on that motherfucker and allow it to be the very thing that propels you forward! 

Stay hard!

Given that I self-published Can’t Hurt Me, it was only available in English to start. Given the demand for the book in other languages, I am happy to announce that it is now available in Spanish. There is a paperback, ebook and audiobook as well now available on Amazon worldwide.

The choice is yours to make- eat shit and don’t workout, you will look like shit OR you can eat better, make the choice to workout and look better. Either way the choice is yours. This shit ain’t fun. It’s a necessity so stop asking questions and burn some fucking calories!

I am honored to be a guest at the upcoming 
@arnoldsportsuk
 . I will be there on September 23rd and look forward to seeing everyone that comes! 

Tickets are now available at http://arnoldsportsfestivaluk.com

I seem to annoy people just by doing me. Well, guess what? A lot of people annoy the hell out of me by not working to their full potential! Next time you start to criticize someone that should be your first clue that maybe something in your own life is lacking. It was for me!

If you are one of the countless people out here giving the bare minimum, you shouldn’t wonder or have to ask why you are where you are in life. You should never be satisfied with giving the bare minimum! Stay hard!

There are a lot of people out here struggling with their weight. The frustration, depression, the desire to quit, loneliness, etc., are all part of the journey. You are not alone! You owe it to yourself not to quit - it’s the best investment you will ever make in your life!

Don’t be the person who wants to turn the water on full blast and fill the glass quickly. While that may get you a full glass of water faster, you failed to gain the mental endurance in that process and therein lies the major tool in accomplishing all of you goals. 

Stay hard!

On the days you don’t want to grind, tune in to me because I guaran-fucking-tee you, no matter what science is saying, sports physios, doctors, meteorologists & anyone else who talks about what we should be doing, I will be out there grinding regardless. 
@joerogan
 

Stay hard!

There really is no situation that is hopeless if you have the willingness to continue to try. It is this small incremental change in how you look at situations that evolves & expands your mindset. You must always believe that it might happen in order to keep moving forward.

Everything in life requires practice. To expand your mind to endure more, you must learn to practice suffering, how to apply and sustain more pressure. Stay hard!

On the 3 year anniversary of Can’t Hurt Me, I want to thank all of the racists, bigots, radical groups, homophobics & all other hate-filled individuals, your ugliness, ignorance and hate has made so many people want to be better that Can’t Hurt Me has now sold 4 million copies.

3rd Annual 4x4x48 Goggins Challenge

We will be starting March 4, 2022, at 8pm PST. It’s a very basic concept and most of you already know what it is. Run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours which totals 48 miles. More details to come in the coming weeks! Stay hard!

It’s important that you take that time to thank yourself. No, you shouldn’t do it for recognition and you shouldn’t do it for thanks but the main reason why you should do it is out of respect and that is respect for yourself. 

Stay hard!

The only thing more contagious than a good attitude is a bad one! Sometimes you need to find the cancer and just get rid of it before it spreads! Make sure in every situation in life you are not the cancer! 

Stay hard!

Some of you stop long before you hear the whistle! In life, when you miss the shot that can tie the game, before you put your head down, look at the scoreboard because I bet you still have time in the game! Stay hard!

As promised, I told you I was going to do a Stay Hard men’s underwear line & it launches tomorrow, Wednesday, November 3rd, at 3pm EST at http://shop.davidgoggins.com

It’s not always going to be 80 and sunny! The obstacle is the opportunity if you are willing to see it that way. Stay hard!

A savage is neither male nor female nor a barbarian, it’s an acquired mindset. You can’t wake up a savage. You can’t just make the decision to become one. It comes with years of refusing to be mediocre. It’s not about winning or losing, it’s about the effort put forth! Stay hard!

Sometimes we get lost in life. We don’t know if we should go up or go down, left or right. We lose our focus, passion, motivation, and desire.  When all that happens, you still must grind! 

Stay hard!

We believe that we are far from our perfect selves. Truth be told, you are only a few rough edges away. Once you polish off those edges, the masterpiece is unveiled. You must believe that you are a work of art in order to be able to imagine it and therefore create it!

In trying to find your true capabilities, it’s inevitable that you will meet failure & disappointment head on. The difference between giving 99% & 100% is a lot bigger than what we think. Never be fooled by a 99% effort! Stay hard!

I would rather someone be upset with me now and get better than like me and get worse.  

Stay hard!

One of the greatest rewards you can ever receive in life is changing someone else’s life for the better just simply by how you have lived your life. I have been very rewarded.  Thank you for the support! 

Stay hard!

Never hide amongst the strongest pillars in your team. Make sure you work your ass off to be one of them! Stay hard!

The pain you are willing to endure reflects how badly you want it! Some of life’s greatest accomplishments come when you are met with pain and are able to push beyond it. 

Stay hard!

Today you are an American! If you don’t love this country, at least honor and celebrate those who have fought and died for the very freedom you use to express your dislike for it!

Stay hard!

For those of you who are looking to be the very best at what you do, the teeter-totter of life may be stuck at the fucking top.

There are a lot of people with a crap ton of knowledge gained from books but don’t even know will work when needed in the real world. The idea of getting knowledge is to put it into practice. Be a practitioner not a theorist! Stay hard!

Stop waiting for people and the world to change - you do the changing! Stay hard!

While you can’t always plan for and anticipate the hurdles ahead, having the right mindset knowing that there will be complications before the finish line is critical in helping tame the inner bitch! Stay hard!

We are stuck in a generation where most people find their answers online. While that too is a very powerful tool, there are many things in life you just can’t Google. Mental hardening is a perishable skill. It’s very important that you do things that suck whenever you can!

Once you realize we all have the ultimate duty & responsibility to ourselves to be the best we can regardless of the situation that lies in front of us, that is when your sacrifice will no longer feel like a sacrifice. It will begin to feel more like you are respecting yourself.

There’s great pressure in having hard-chargers in your inner circle. These are the people who let you know when you think you’re great, you’re truly only good.  Rather than seeing those people as pressure, consider them a privilege in your life!!

There are valuable lessons to learn in the deep end! Life is the most unexpected thing you will ever encounter. It loves taking you to the deep end just to see if you can fucking swim! Stay hard!

For anyone interested in participating in the 2nd annual 4x4x48 Challenge, all you need to know can be found at http://gogginschallenge.com

How do you transform yourself from ordinary? You have to do the exact opposite of what everyone else is doing. If you don’t want to be ordinary, you have to act like every meal you have is the last fucking meal you will ever have! You must have an insatiable desire for more!

2nd Annual 4x4x48 Challenge March 5-7 starting at 8pm PST. Go to my page on Instagram and Facebook for more details including giveaways! Stay hard!

A Disciple of Discipline!

Don’t fear the billboard of your life! Stay hard!

Having the time to find your “why” is a fucking luxury or is it merely another excuse to procrastinate and put off attacking what needs to be done?

Bet on yourself! We all know the saying “when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.”- fuck that shit! Just eat the motherfucking lemon! Only you know what you truly want to be in life & where you want to go. Don’t allow any mf’er to tell you your worth & the path you need to take

The human mind is more powerful than anyone can possibly even begin to imagine. The problem is that we are losing our imagination of what is truly possible. 

Unshackle your mind from the self-imposed constraints you have put on it!

Don’t dip your toe in the water like a little bitch! If you are going to jump into the water of life, don’t test it to see how cold it is- JUST JUMP IN! Stay hard!

Just because we are not wearing a uniform anymore does not give us permission to take days off. We must continue to step up and lead from the front! Stay hard!

A lot of us in life are always hoping for the test to be over. The test is never over....when the end is unknown, are you going to bitch out or stay hard?! My suggestion will always be to STAY HARD!

A little bit of clowning around that goes on after a 240 mile race!!!

David Goggins Clothing Launching 10/15/20

If the second you hear something you don’t like, you get defensive and stop listening, how the fuck are we ever going to create change?

In life, a lot of us are looking for that desk furthest from the teacher in the school of life. We are hoping that we can hide in the back and never got called on. While that will work for a little bit, mark my word, they will call on you! Life has a great way of exposing us all.

Beware of spitting in the wind! You never know when that motherfucker might just change direction!

Just know that even if you aren’t saying the words aloud, everyone around you can feel your negative energy!

When shit gets tough in life don’t be wasteful. Sometimes all you need to do is chip away at the rough edges. Once the rough edges have been smoothed out, you will see just how special and unique you are!

Don't waste shit!

Do you suffer from Chest-Nut Syndrome?

It is important to get rid of and shitcan all the people who make it hard for you to breathe. 

Each one of us only has so many breaths that we breathe in our lifetime. Make sure each and every breath is well spent!

The more you succeed in life, the more you get up when you fall, the more you fail yet continue to try- know one thing- the real estate you own in the minds of the haters, doubters and trolls is permanent!

Always be ready to do one more than the motherfucker who is next to you! That can be one more of anything! 

Stay hard!

The hardest thing in the world is to continuously fall and stay motivated! But those who can will start to create great separation between them and those who choose the path of least resistance! It's not supposed to be easy. Life is designed to test the human soul!

Stay hard!

Be ready when the fucking whistle blows!

When “setbacks” arise, we must remember who the fuck we are when we are at our best because life is not designed to pick you up when you fall. Life is designed to teach you how to pick your own ass up when you fall!  Stay hard!!

By understanding what fatigue feels like, it enables us to gain the advantage. A true champion has experienced fatigue many times and yet always finds what they still haven’t given! When we are at our worst, we must always know we still have more to give! Stay hard!

There are people out there using this time to hone their savagery skills. If you are not physically better than someone, make sure you gain the mental edge! Stay hard!

Suffering is not for the weak! It’s for the motherfucker looking for the beginning of his/her soul! You want to see where most people’s desire and will ends and yours begins! Stay savage!

When shit hits the fan and everyone you know starts to look around to see who is going to step up, make sure they are all looking in your direction! Stay hard!

When times are hard and you are mentally and physically exhausted and feel like you have nothing left and all you want to do is quit, that’s when you find out who you are! Stay hard!

We have to visualize a successful victory before we even start a very difficult challenge. Stay hard! #canthurtme

“If you can dream and not make dreams your master...” - Rudyard Kipling

The most important step you ever take in life is your next one. Don’t get your feet stuck in concrete because of the fear of the haters. Haters are those who would say that if you walked on water, it would be only because you can’t swim!

When David Meets Goliath!                            Go out like a motherfucking savage!

It is very important in life 2 learn 2 dig ur claws into the fucking dirt 2 climb ur way out of the grave that ur mind led u into directly. Learn 2 talk 2 urself in a way that very few people will ever understand. In ur darkest moments, u must become the devil to get out of hell!

When you are exhausted, weak and tired and everyone around you looks just as bad as you or even worse- that’s the perfect time for you to make a statement. You let everyone around you know that when their life ends, that’s when yours begins!

Some of you won’t give a shit or even comprehend what I am about to say but, for the titans, warriors and motherfucking savages out there, you will know EXACTLY what I am talking about. Learn to forgo personal desires and comforts to earn real estate in the minds of the weak!

While color, race, gender, etc., may always be an issue on some level, you need to be of the mindset that if another motherfucker that looks like you is successful, you can do the same! True savagery doesn’t discriminate so be a fucking savage and attack life!

Your entitled mind is dead weight!

When you got knocked to the canvas, what the fuck are you going to do? 

“Everybody has a plan until they get hit in the mouth”-Mike Tyson. 

Stay. Fucking. Hard!

Don’t forget to fly the fucking plane!

If you are having problems staying with the program, it simply might be because you are lazy and don’t want it badly enough. Sometimes you need to face the cold hard truth.

Father Time waits for no one!

Merry fucking Christmas!

The truly successful people in life have learned one thing- and it might be the GREATEST SEPARATOR BETWEEN AVERAGE AND BECOMING NUCLEAR!!! - and that is learning to do when you don't want to do! Stay hard!

We are doing people 0 favors by not teaching adversity, failure, & just how brutal life can be on all levels! Today give thanks that years ago when u fell down in life some motherfucker looked at u & said “get the fuck up!” It is truly one of the best lessons u can teach someone!

Attitude is absolutely everything in life! The only thing more contagious than a good attitude is a bad one. There's a fucking hero in all of us! It's up to us to chip away the rough edges to make that hero appear. STAY HARD!

Every morning we wake up to the scene of our lives & have a small window of opportunity to make a decision that could change our lives for the better or worse. That window of opportunity starts shrinking the second we wake up so don’t hesitate. Make the right decision! Stay hard

Know this- we are all being tested and, at the end of the day, the big houses & bank accounts, medals, certificates, etc., won’t mean a fucking thing! You will be judged by the battle wounds on your mind and body and how many life miles you put on while you were broken.

Don’t be afraid of the dark! 
It’s one thing we should learn to get used to. Dark times are not hopeless times. Make your mind adjust even though the only thing it wants to do is run away. The more we face hardships in life, the easier it will become to navigate the darkness.

Success comes when the fucking whisper becomes the only voice you hear! You are not done, motherfucker! Stay hard!

“Unofficial” Finisher of 250 miles!

From the trail earlier this morning... go to IG for more recent updates! Cell signal is hard to come by!

For those of you who have been following along with David’s race, you likely know that he was forced to leave the race at around the mile 200 marker (which would mean 214ish miles for David).

Unfortunately, David… https://instagram.com/p/B3mUtMcljiT/?igshid=4jw2s2am5lxy…

Update on Moab 240 below. Stay hard!

En route to the start line of Moab 240... he is heading home!!! For the next few days, while David is running, I will be posting updates on his behalf. #stayhard

Life can choke u out if you let it! Our minds are like circuit breakers- when u overload it, it blows! Make sure u find a way to reset that blown circuit breaker in ur mind! When it blows, it doesn’t mean shit is broken, it just means u need to go back to the panel and reset it!

A lot of people in life are very successful but I think very few are fulfilled. Fulfillment comes when you know you tried your hardest and have given your absolute best when responding to life with “I must go on!” Stay hard!

So many of us are waiting for the exact right time to attack. We wait for the stars to align be4 we make our move in life.  Truth is- there is only today & what you make of it! You have to learn to do when you don’t want to do!

Don’t allow this weakened society to make you believe that it’s ok to just be a mediocre human being. Life isn’t about a trophy- but it sure is the fuck about achieving more than what you ever thought was possible! Stay hard always!

Sometimes you need to just look at yourself when you are trying your hardest but still not succeeding and simply suck it the fuck up and say “I still haven’t done enough.” So when is it enough? Only you have the answer to that. What is “it” worth to you?

So- the real question is who are YOU at the core of your fucking soul? The people who have the strength to stand alone and speak their truth are the people who truly change the world.

Always be asking yourself “what’s next?” and don’t sit back on past accomplishments for too long! I am not saying not to celebrate your accomplishments but I am saying the longer you keep your head up your ass, the less oxygen you have to breathe! Earn greatness everyday!!

A savage mindset is a conditioned mindset that knows quitting is not part of the plan. It knows that it has to find a way around any and all obstacles to complete the mission. Stay hard!

When you stop blaming other people for your problems....when you stop procrastinating, bitching and complaining about how unfair life is...it is truly amazing what the fuck you can accomplish with your life!

Taking souls happens very easily and oftentimes when you aren’t even trying! The conversation after this staredown was quite entertaining to say the least!

In sports today, there is a lot of talk about “load management.” A lot of us apply that same principle to our personal, everyday lives. We scale back and falsely manage our own expectations of ourselves. The first thing you have to do is stop looking at yourself as simply normal!

Like cooking a turkey on Thanksgiving... some inexperienced people dress the turkey & start cooking it not realizing that before you dress it, you need to clean that motherfucker out! Same thing applies to our lives- before you dress it up, you’ve got it clean it up!

Check out this new interview with 
@edmylett
 - we touch upon a lot of new shit. 

Thank u all for supporting my book Can’t Hurt Me. I am truly humbled by the response to the book. The number of lives positively impacted & forever changed by the book is astounding! 

Stay hard!

Haters Can Be Your Ultimate Fuel Source! 

Fuck that bullshit about kill them with kindness, torture those motherfuckers with success! Stay hard as woodpecker lips!

If you are looking for soft, feel-good messages, maybe check out @softmotherfucker as u aren’t going to find them here! The softer u are on yourself, inevitably the softer u will become! Anyone of us can be a savage, you just have to be willing to do what others don’t want to do!

No matter how far you have made it in life, you need to be that dog waiting for scraps to hit the floor. If you maintain that dog mentality, your refrigerator will never be full! You will always have that Day One, Week One mentality. You will stay a hunter vs being the hunted!

Make sure when it is your time to go, you leave with two hands firmly wrapped around life itself fighting to the bitter end!

In life, we are always in this tug of war between knowing what we should do and doing what we want to do. Victory over yourself is one of the best feelings a human being can ever experience. It is our obligation to find victory everyday within ourselves!

The scars on our brains are a reminder that our past is real BUT it’s up to us to grind those scars down into a fine powder until they no longer affect the outcome of our life.

You might be the one person who tells someone a cold hard truth and they may not want to talk to you for a while as a result but, once they look back, you will be the one that changed their life for the better.

The further you walk away from accountability, the weaker you become Character is not built on the couch. Stay hard!

Permanent results require a grinding mentality. Nothing great ever comes from taking the four line highway! Pick up the shovel and start digging your own path. Make your own road map and build those mental callouses!!! Make that shit permanent as hell!!!

Living a life avoiding failure does only one thing for you: it never gives you the opportunity to see what you are truly capable of!

Modern society is slowly trying to silence the voice of discipline therefore don’t look anywhere when you fail other than at yourself. Merry Christmas- you are the boss of your life where no one can tell you shit!

Be aware of the pat on the back! It might be the one thing that holds you back. Don’t expect a pat on the back for the shit that a human being is supposed to be doing every day of their lives and that is being the best that he/she can be in every situation in their life.

What’s Causing You To Act Like A Bitch At Times? If u find urself worrying more about other people & wtf they are doing with their lives & how unfair life is to u, take a moment to stop & realize that u are being a whiny bitch. Focus on bettering urself & hold urself accountable.

It’s very easy to neglect to train the most important thing- the mind! Stress your mind during training or it will never grow. You must find a way to give ur mind no way out so when the hard times come during the race or test, ur brain is conditioned under the hardest of times.

There are times when u are being judged or held to a diff’t standard than others for any number of reasons. This is when u take it upon urself to be the baddest mf’er to have ever done it! Whatever “it” is for u! If they dislike u, make them dislike u even more by being the best!

Readiness entails having a mindset that after getting ur ass kicked at work, at school, on the field, etc., u immediately drive to the library to study more, head to the gym to get more, etc. Aleader goes back to the very scene of where they got their ass kicked earlier for more.

Never allow the fear of being judged make you not try to be exceptional! One of the worst things we can do in life is to listen to people who aren’t even trying to do what we are attempting to do.

Don’t waste so much time overthinking the process! In most areas of our life, we all have enough sense to know what needs to be done. The problem is that we act ignorant about it as it allows us to prolong the start of the process! Get out of your head and get to work!

It is critical that you always have goals in front of you so that the negative things that will happen to you don’t derail you and your plans. Make sure that you are the only one who owns real estate in your mind!

The blending-in-mentality is affecting the world today. That said, this is the most perfect time to strike! With so many people having that kind of mentality, it is prime time to stand out from the crowd. There is a price to pay for being a standout but, trust me, it is worth it!

When u dream big, u must know that it will entail u falling off the horse many times along the journey. When ur mind is telling u to quit & give up, remember all the repetition & sacrifice made along the way. Sometimes the only thing we can do is sack it the fuck up and press on!

Always look to be uncommon amongst uncommon people. Never look to just get the invitation and fit in.

If you are one of the people who bitch all the time, take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror. Chances are the only motherfucker you need to bitch at is yourself for not being squared away.

Always be prepared to readjust! 

Life doesn’t always pan out as you want it. Don’t allow it to hijack your brain! Be open-minded to the possibilities in front of you! There’s always a way, we just have to figure the out the equation!

When backed into a corner with no other answers, sometimes the best answer is to say fuck it and go for broke. Some times saying “fuck it” at the right time can be a very powerful thing. It tells your mind that you are willing to do whatever it takes to get to the other side.

Have the courage to build yourself up from the ground up. If you are born thinking that you are nothing or worthless, that’s the absolute perfect start! Learn to flip that shit to work to your advantage. Some of the best fuel in the world is having the underdog mentality.

If a person in your circle knows there is a possibility of being spot checked at anytime, he/she starts keeping their shit wired tight at all times. Next time you feel someone in your circle is slipping, including yourself, spot check their ass!

We must live our lives to a higher standard. The standard we set for ourselves must makes us feel uncomfortable. If the standard you set for yourself allows you to feel comfortable, you must re-evaluate the bar you set for yourself.

The true benefit of working out is what it does 2 ur mindset. Looking better is an added +, the animalistic mentality that comes w/ getting after it on the regular is where I benefitted the most. It’s the repetition & self-discipline that changes self-esteem from the inside out.

Control the quitting/coasting mind! Rather than being in constant pursuit of that day off,  be so locked in to bringing your best that you don’t even know what day or time it is because it doesn’t even fucking matter. The break and the day off are coming -but not today!

You have to show your mind and body who is boss! 

There are no special people, just special minds and the mind is something we can sharpen through hard work.

FOR THOSE ASKING, THE HARDCOVER OF CAN’T HURT ME WILL BE AVAILABLE AGAIN On AMAZON THE WEEK OF 12/17.

Thank you all for the support! It’s very humbling to see all of your comments and feedback. #canthurtme

I would like you all to be the first to know that the audiobook for Can’t Hurt Me came out last night on Audible. 

What you all just heard is a 30-second sample of the 13 hour audiobook. The audio version includes tons of bonus content not featured anywhere else. #CantHurtMe

Always check your mentality! Never allow it to get the best of you!

It's important to realize that life has many unpleasant, difficult, trying and unfair times. Stop looking for that day off or break from that cycle. Life is the ultimate training ground! #CantHurtMe

You have to look at everything as a new opportunity! Stop looking at things the way they appear.

To most people, it’s just a doorway. If you incorporate this workout, you will never look at a doorway the same. #CantHurtMe

Be the warrior ready each day to show up at the Colosseum of Life!

The key is to quiet your mind while in mental hell and embrace whatever obstacle is in front of you with open arms. We must learn to conserve energy and to control the emotional and mental stresses of our setbacks. #CantHurtMe

The video says it all. You MUST change the way you look at discomfort! #canthurtme https://instagram.com/p/Bphn7uIn2FB/?utm_source=ig_twitter_share&igshid=sj6drh5ysire…

Don’t let whatever disability you have- be it mental or physical- cause your mind to close to the possibilities! There is always something we can do to better ourselves. Once your mind closes, you will become a prisoner within your own mind and unable to unshackle it! #CantHurtMe

My social media posts are not about kissing my own ass- the intention of every post is to force you to think about your own life & realize how much you are leaving on the table. I want everyone who follows me to fucking crush life & everything in it!

Use people’s comfort as your strength! 

Why workout at 3am? Because no one else is. In life you are constantly looking for an edge. You have to find it when and where no one else is looking. #CantHurtMe

When we find the courage to go deep into our minds, we can locate what specific fuse blew in our brains to make us settle for a mediocre life. Finding the blown fuse is easy but, in order to fix the blown mental fuse, we need the willingness to change the way we think.

Our minds have the tactical advantage over us at all times. It’s the only thing in the world that is on time, every time. Your mind can be your biggest enemy if you haven’t mastered it! Like the saying goes, keep your friends close and your enemies closer. #canthurtme

If you are always comparing yourself to mediocre people, that's exactly what you will be! Hang around people who make you uncomfortable because they are on a quest to find more! 

Comfort is a fucking drug!!! Once you get used to it, it becomes fucking addictive. #CantHurtMe

The most important conversations you will ever have are the ones you have with yourself. Never let the weakness of this world infiltrate your mind! To do that you must truly know yourself! Don't allow people to puppet master you from being fucking great! #canthurtme

Never be afraid to suffer, it's just a tool that some people aren't willing to use. It's that very tool that strengthens weak people.

Sometimes talking doesn't resolve the problem. Sometimes you must go to war with yourself to fix yourself.

#RogerThatMentality

I'm happy as hell, but I'm also real. Happy didn't get me here. But going through hell to get to where I'm at made me happy.

The truth is most of us have the strength to handle almost anything. With your mind and your hands you can make your own success!

Stand tall when life is kicking your ass. Visualize how you want your life and don't stop until the picture in your mind is a reality.

It doesn’t matter the weather, the elements, the time of day, the location, the occasion, the allergies, the geography...#BeyondMotivated

Learn to reset your goals when you realize you won’t achieve your original ones. Don’t just quit. #resetyourgoals #JFK50

Take time to find out what you truly want & attack it w/ reckless abandon like there's no tomorrow. Because tomorrow isn't guaranteed.

#neverquit

Being driven means your conscience won't let you "waste time" sitting on the couch watching TV. #BeDriven #Multitask #RelentlessPursuit

Tomorrow I'm doing the JFK 50 mile running race. We don't grow by staying within our limits. How far outside of your limits are you going?

Outwork everybody. #BeyondMotivated

Part 2 of yesterday's video. #itsyourjourney

Don't let the bad days get you down. Fight through them. Persistence is key. Stay the course!

#ownit

#NoExcuses

Learn to control what you can control.

Don't be afraid to set big goals for yourself! #AskGoggins #goals

Re·lent·less | adjective: oppressively constant; incessant.A word you need to understand to be successful. #WordOfTheDay

Be proud of what you've achieved in your life but never satisfied. Never stop looking for the last grain of grit in your soul. #NoFinishLine

Envision your success. #MotivationMonday

If you refuse to quit, enemies can never defeat you. Don't lose the internal battle going on in your head. #WinTheInternalBattle

Sometimes you have to go to the darkness. #StartYourJourney #BeyondMotivated

#TY to everyone who reached out today! It means a lot and I appreciate it. #VeteransDay

Thank you doesn't even begin to cover it. #VeteransDay http://bit.ly/2fIpcc7

You'll think more about the things you didn’t do than the things you did. Stop telling yourself there’s always tomorrow. #TBT #Badwater

It doesn’t matter if you “like it”. Discipline builds strength. #BeyondMotivated

Nickels & Dimes are a great way to train your body for hard core endurance events. Try to do continuously for 15 min w/ a goal of 1 hour.

@Picoalex1
 If you feel like you're going to permanently injury yourself, that is bad suffering.

True transformation is not something you can see in a picture. It’s a callused mind & self-awareness that can’t be shaken.#TuesdayMotivation

Take a SIU pill and get out there.   #beyondmotivated #suckitup https://instagram.com/p/BMJ4rwIgVnY/

Through failure we can re-examine how to complete the task we just failed. #ThreeHellWeeks #ThreePullUpAttempts #CountlessFailures

If you refuse to quit, enemies can never defeat you. Don't lose the internal battle going on in your head. #DriveOn #WinTheInternalBattle

To defeat hell, you have to become hell. Are you willing to make the ultimate sacrifice? #NavySEAL #3HellWeeks #AskGoggins

The things that keep me up at night are the times I've quit or didn’t see things through. That’s what drives me everyday. #BeyondMotivated

Fallacies of thinking-The human mind loves itself. What serves it, flatters it, & gives it what it wants. It strikes down what threatens it.

#TBT to my first #triathlon. Like many things in life, you just have to SHOW UP, get on the starting line and go for it. #BeyondMotivated

Had a good time live tweeting tonight. Hope we can do it again soon. #PowerHour #AskGoggins

@AmeliaBourdeau
 Do a lot of calf stretches and massage. Also, look into magnesium supplements.

. 
@Spinbeck
 Maybe one day!

. @Alex_Davis66 Both but more on the distance side.

. 
@AustinKayatin
 Start running. Get your lower extremities used to the pounding. Stress fractures cause a lot of trainees to drop out.

. 
@GreggYaeger
 Yes, I deployed and fought for my country. Thank you!

. 
@KellyStevenson_
 A diet that wasn't approved by Jenny Craig! Too long to answer here but will touch upon in future posts.

. @mandajp07 don't know of any preparation but it helps if you're very passionate about the task at hand. U fight through sleep deprivation.

. 
@shawndeemac
 I don't have a routine for jet lag- I recommend taking a SIU (Suck It Up) pill with a can of hard. It works for me!

. @SeanKram3r Try again! My pull-up record took three times, three #hellweeks, etc. Stay in the fight!

. @pawlak_mark

 It's a lot on the individual but you also need to be understanding to a point. Every1 handles PTSD differently. Good luck

 ZERO. 0. NADA. But I am constantly battling other health issues on a daily basis.

@barefootherapy
 I didn't train the next day but 10 days later I ran a 3:08 marathon!

@RJPreston1
 First 100 mile race.

@dhmaddux
 One big way is knowing how to calm yourself down. Learn to control what you can control.

. 
@dhmaddux
 Find a number of pull-ups you can do on the minute for 20 minutes to an hour and keep adding to each minute as you get stronger.

. @Jaime94328427 Knowing when and how hard to push is key as is proper diet and rest.

. 
@BrynerKid
 Pre- steel cut oatmeal with blueberries. Post-  Protein shake with a bunch of fruit and carbohydrate mix.

. @pawlak_mark As long as I am helping people, I like. It pushed me out of my comfort zone.

. 
@barefootherapy
 It was Frozen Otter. 70 miles, -5 degrees, 8 inches of snow with standard running sneakers. Feet paid the price obviously!

 Seeing his face when I broke the ice on the frozen lake and told him to jump in it!

@Ron_Ward_III
 Have the mindset of working towards being the hardest man that God ever created.

. 
@DvorakBJ
 YES, IT WILL. I had severe stress fractures while training and was unable to run, I spent countless hours on the elliptical.

. 
@Andy_Winchester
 The path I was on was not a good one. I wanted to be proud of the man that I saw in the mirror and decided to take action

 Tons! At Ranger school, sleep-deprived on Day 40, a Ranger Trainee saw a log and thought it was a box of donuts! #hallucination

. @pawlak_mark From off the couch to first 100 mile race was 4 days. Had never run longer than 20 miles at one time and hadn't run in 1 year

 If I'm invited on as a guest, I will be there! Jocko was a great SEAL Officer.

@ColbyJoe40
 I do in time. I have used several throughout the years. My diet largely depends on what I am doing with my workout.

. @smlindse1120 I'm exercising my 5th amendment right here (at the advice of others who are far more pc than me)! :-)

. @Earl_DaSquirrel Outwork everybody in every category. Have the highest PT scores of everyone and show the best leadership qualities.

. @pawlak_mark Give me some questions to save you from the debate!

. @CharAllen12 I focus on only one goal. That's the only way you can give your all. Sometimes balance goes out the door. #askgoggins

 Taped my ankles all the way top of my calves. Compression tape saved me. The pressure ulcers on the top of my feet- NOT FUN!

I’ve been receiving so many questions lately for #AskGoggins that I’ve decided to see how many questions I can answer in an hour. #PowerHour

Every morning I eat steel cut oatmeal w/ blueberries. It sits well in my stomach before I go running. #AskGoggins #BreakfastOfChampions

Everybody comes to a point when they want to quit. It’s what you do at that moment that determines who you are. #NoExcuses #MondayMotivation

If your life stayed the same as it is today.. forever.. would you be happy with that? If not, I challenge you to make a change.

Do something that makes you uncomfortable every day. Get out of your comfort zone. #BeyondMotivated
