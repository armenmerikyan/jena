We wanted to share some quick tips to choosing the right running shoes because we see bad running shoes being a part of the issues we see here in the practice!
1. Know your running shoes.
2. Know your feet.
3. Track your running distances. 
4. Know your laces.

How to Prepare:
- Mix the maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic, garlic salt, and pepper.
- Coat Salmon with the mixture.

- Preheat oven to 400F
- Bake salmon uncovered 20 minutes, or until easily flaked with a fork.

Superfood recipe with our roasted Maple Salmon!

- 2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pound salmon

Top health tips part 1:
- Learn to do stretching exercises when you wake up.
- Don’t skip breakfast.
- Brush for at least two minutes.
- Brush your teeth with your ‘other’ hand, take a new route to work or choose your clothes based on sense of touch rather than sight.

Happy Labor Day! Labor Day is a day set aside to pay tribute to working men and women; it honors the American labor movement and the contributions that workers have made to the strength, prosperity, laws and well-being of the country.

Take care of yourself before your body starts to hurt so that you never have to go through pain, stiffness, soreness, or even worse disease, ailments, or surgery.

Make a plan. A goal without a plan is just a wish. If you have a goal of getting healthy, progressing in your career, being a better person, it isn't actionable without a plan to which you can commit.

So in order to reduce the frequency and severity of spinal misalignments, we have to follow the ABC's:

1. Align your vertebrae
2. Break up old scar tissue
3. Correct left-right muscle imbalances

Happy Sunday! Remember to eat well, live well, and see your chiropractor! We will see you getting healthy in our practice this week!

Chiropractors work from the inside out and focus on the nervous system and spine which control your bodily functions and thus control your health. So if you like to get healthy the right way, start from the inside then out.

Your goal?

Relief - Feel better for the least amount of investment in time and money.
Correction - Stabilize and retrain the muscles and ligaments of my spine.
Maintenance - Preserve the progress I've made.
Prevention - Avoid losing my health.
Wellness - Be all that I can be.

Did you set your goals for this week? Happy Monday, let's have a focused, healthy week!

We hope you had a restful and enjoyable summer weekend. Make sure to get to sleep early tonight, to get ready for a happy, productive, healthy week! We will see all of our #diamondbar community in here this week!

#corporatewellness - Make your work desk or work station more posture friendly. You spend majority of your day and week sitting down working. Make sure you are conscious of how it's affecting your body daily. A little investment in your day-to-day now, pays off in the long run.

Starting off our week with a #patientappreciation for Yvonne, who left some fantastic feedback for us! We are grateful, Yvonne!

We focus on what is originating from your pains, aches, stiffness, nervous system functionality, internal issues like digestion, headaches, etc. to make sure you're back to how you're body is supposed to function regularly.

Thank you, Conrad for the great feedback! We work very hard to receive that feedback from patients like you. Have a wonderful weekend!

What did you accomplish this week? Did you check off the goals you wanted to focus on? If not, write down why you didn't so you can avoid it next week. Making slow progress is better than no progress!

Mondays are usually the least happiest day of the week...Why don't we go out of our way to make it the best day of the week. Plan something, do something, get together with friends or family. If we find ways to make every day a great day, we lead healthier lives. Happy Monday.

Comment/Share - What makes the most sense when you have pain somewhere in your body that you've been dealing with for years?

Ignore it?
Take pain medication?
Ice it every day and night?
Avoid moving it?
Or correct the cause of the problem for good?

Through all of our years helping our patients get healthy through our care, most importantly advocating them to stay healthy long after, we find it very tough for everyone to stay motivated...

Years of poor nutrition, poor posture, exercise, sports, injuries, daily movement, etc., our bodies are going to wear and tear. Our spine will not "work" the same way compared to when we were younger. So, we owe it to our bodies to take the time to take care of it.

Today we explore the notion that people need to go to the Chiropractor 1x a week for the rest of their lives in order to stay healthy for the rest of their lives.

The short answer is no. It's usually more visits in the beginning to get started and only maintenance thereafter.

So next time you think about a new regime or new habit, remember that slow progress is better than no progress!

If we shift our mindset to being grateful and then stay positive for the changes we're making, even if it is as small as more water per day, we start to encourage ourselves to continue making an effort towards our goals.

One great mindset to be in during any health journey or when starting up a new regime is to know that slow progress is much better than either never starting in the first place, or stopping if we don't see tremendous progress with our energy or weight right away.

#mondaymotivation Slow progress is better than no progress.

Eat well, live well, be happy - Happy Sunday!

A great tip for habit changing: Eliminate the "Ah-hah" moments. The times where we abandon our habits completely because we justify it. If we make goals to eliminate those moments each week slowly, then we will stay a lot more consistent.

Quick morning habits to start doing this weekend:

1. Remember your dreams
2. Make your bed
3. Drink Lots of water
4. Brush your teeth with the opposite hand
5. Deep breathing exercises
6. Brain tea
7. Journaling
8. Workout
9. Brain power smoothie
10. Daily reading

Happy Sunday - Time to meal our weeks for healthy habits, meal prepping, and scheduling your Chiropractic appointments starting tomorrow!

Gather your organic ingredients:
1). 1 cup of whole strawberries
2). 2 cups of seedless organic watermelon
3). 1/2 vine of tomatoes
4). 2 cups of fresh baby spinach (I usually put more)
5). 1/2 cup of water if needed

Stay well, stay positive, and you will live better.
