Become a master of the little things!

It's usually never just one thing causing us problems. It's several little things that need attention. What little things are we over looking?

Here's a list of 5 things recovery won't do to you

1. Make your life miserable
2. Stop you from going to events or being around people who drink
3. Ruin your marriage/friendships
4. Create more stress
5. Destroy your health

People do not decide their futures; they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures. - F. Matthias Alexander

@elonmusk
 As much as I have loved my Tesla's (two of them) the customer service experience involved in my second one and the returning of my first one has solidified I will likely never get another Tesla again. Love what you stand for but Tesla customer service is close 2 ATT

@elonmusk
 ATT however has an excuse for their terrible CS.. They don't use Americans.. Tesla has no excuse.

I don't care what kind of hate people send my way, I'm going to bed at night and waking up the next morning continuing my mission. If they are mad about what I'm doing with my speaking and the lives I help wait till they see what I do with 
@pHwellnessc

It's better to be made fun or or spoken down to for what you love than to be hated on and spoken down to for doing something you think others want you to do, something you honestly hate on the inside.

The truth is, everyone is going to send "attacks" our direction.. it doesn't matter what you do. Some people just can't be happy for others. My job isn't to make everyone happy, it's to make the most with the gifts I was given and be who I am no matter what. That's your job too

Before long, I had changed so much to be accepted I was not even close to my authentic person, I had essentially given up my power and a lot of you are in the same boat in the process of losing yourself for the opinion and approval of others.

As a young person, people would make fun or disapprove of my path. My desire to be accepted by others would cause me to change who I am or what I'm doing to appease the masses... The desired result never came to fruitation. People would just make fun of the changes I made.

Here's how I've learned to process these those of events because they are not new and they've occured as they have for others, since I was a youngster.

@TonyMhoffman
 looking forward to your visit to Lexington, Kentucky and sharing your story with us here 
@HopeCenterLex

This weekend I got a call from someone I've known for a long time. They wanted to let me know that they don't like that I'm paid to speak and that another person I've known for a long time feels the same way.

Having found gratitude in the darkest places a human can experience has made me incredibly humbled by all that life has blessed me w/ over the last 14 years of sobriety. I can say w/ confidence not giving up when everyone else gave up on me was the best decision Ive ever made

I'm sure this scam method of making millions more per year will find it's way in court.

I love how

 now basically strong arms riders into spending more money to be picked up in a timely manner.. if you don't pay the premium you're forced to wait 10-20 min before they release your ride to a driver.. Greed is a funny thing.

My dog just blew her anal glands so bad in my bed I told her I was proud of her for it. Holy hell, it woke me from a dead sleep the smell was so intense #DogDad

Riddle me this..

Why do people put money down on a car to decrease the payment? It makes zero sense to hand over liquid cash on a liability. I'm baffled at people's inability to understand leasing/purchasing a vehicle

 China used bleach foggers to disinfect, when and if we do this, I'd like to be considered for the job but only if I get a hazmat suit I can show my grandkids some day

Traveling on a plane couldn't be safer right now. Every damn passenger has a Costco size container of wipes and is wiping every crevice before they sit down. If you don't take advantage of the lower airfare rates you're a damn fool

I joined back Twitter due to ur glowcast recording, checked on YouTube and fb.

As I was walking by a homeless guy this morning I what's up and asked him how he was doing. He said to me, "What are you Vanilla Ice's brother?"

Definitely an insult but I walked away remembering ice ice baby was on top of the charts and I must look like a chart toping sensation

@LoriFullbright
 and Mayes County DROP Task Force for making this possible!

I've opened two bottles of Topo Chico (sparkling water) both have exploded upon opening.. 

Both times i've looked at the bottle and said, "Why?" "Why are you doing this?"

For flow of traffic. Cash Registers are usually at the center of the store - thus exits are usually closest to the cash registers. They don't want people entering the store to have to go through people exiting the store.

Why does Walmart put the entrance doors on the left and exit on the right?

Every bathroom should have a sign reminding people, if you wink it, sink it! 

Courtesy flushes are like holding the door for someone, it's a thoughtful gesture that makes life a little easier for others while expending little energy yourself..

Fellas.. listen up

If you are unhappy or not reaching the place in life you want AND you piss on toilet seats in public,  leaving a mess for someone else behind you to see... THAT is exactly why you're stuck in life or unhappy. I promise you, it's that simple.

I'm excited to welcome

 to share his incredible story at the

 Arena at 5pm today. You don't want to miss it! #thebestisourstandard

We live in a era where gluten and processed foods are the devil but alcohol, Adderall, weed, percs and xans are the key to a good time or dealing with problems... #staywoke peeps #thinkabout it

I think my new approach to getting

 attention is going to be running into him at the airport#patience #gratitude #empathy

Not everything that glitters is gold

Quick but great time in the St Area! Back to Cali for a couple days!

I'm craving round table pizza. Arguably the best thick crust pizza on Earth

If you haven't been apart of my life in the last 4 weeks, chances are I can't remember your name. Not sure if that's cause I'm old and have had 6 concussions or because my brain is blown out from drugs #youdecide #hugsnotdrugs

Is it national wear slides with socks day? I must have missed the memo because everyone at LAX is running this timeless look today #Styles4less

Dude just passed me on fwy using the blinker doing about 110mph..Like the cops gonna go easy on em cause of it.

Several people have told me I have my read receipts on.. I'm aware.. I want people to know when they're getting ghosted

Got invited to be on Hot 97 Wednesday in New York. Been a fan of that station since the DJ Envy mixtape days. Schedules won't make it possible though

Living on a plane paid off today. Jumped on new flights getting me home 10hrs sooner.

I feel like everything takes 2 steps more to accomplish on the iPhone compared to Android #Itjustworks

Touched down in Tulsa for a few days!

Man, some of these celebrity Twitter beefs are intense. Glad to see people still beefing online #poopreading

I have no words

Always maintain the mindset of a student. No matter how accomplished you become. #Mindset https://youtu.be/c7G8I5TuyXc

Just saw a guy walking down the street holding a sliding glass door.. reminding me of Wayne's world #oddsighting

I got to this gym this morning and couldn't believe how empty it was for a Monday morning.. let that sink in #IamTIRED

@TonyMhoffman
 

Man, I have to tell you. You made an impact in my life and how I view my recovery. You are truly an inspiration. 
Thank you

Fall speaking tour has resulting in me being way out of shape. Sheesh

Thank you so much for coming...your message was very powerful!!

If all we told was Harris's story & how much we miss him, it wouldn't change decision making of teen struggling w/ mental health disorder/sports injury/brain changes. Teens must understand paths to substance misuse/addiction-?s to ask-how to get help-support a friend #WhatIsCODA?

Stories of overdose deaths not enough, teens know "drugs are bad" and we miss our loved ones. Prevention focused on paths to substance misuse/addiction like mental health challenges, sports injury, brain changes caused by use & empowering teens will turn the tide #WhatIsCODA?

Still haven't seen an iPhone 10 in the wild.

Grateful to be with West York Area High School students this morning in #Pennsylvania

Wonderful time at Delaware Valley High School today! Thank you Hope 4 Pike and all of the DV staff and students! #OneChoice

I use to buy phones every 6 weeks. Last night I put an iPhone X in the cart twice. Couldn't pull the trigger

The reason you're unhappy, anxious or depressed may not be because of you but because of the people around you!
