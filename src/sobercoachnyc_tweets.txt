What is Shadow Addiction or a #Covid-reset?

Interesting discussion with 
@terri_cole
 about  the increase of alcohol/drug consumption by non-addicts during the pandemic.

Loved getting together with 
@terri_cole
 to talk about the  substance-use uptick since the pandemic in people who'd always been moderate drinkers and weekend warriors.
